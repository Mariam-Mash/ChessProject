# ChessProject
This is a Chess Project implimentation attempt for advanced OOP class.



Most of the code is taken from https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/SearchAndDestroyChess,
which is a graphic implementation of Kriegspiel chess game using C++. 


In the main class there is a test function, which involves some moves, which are implemented.
